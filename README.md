# arcana-example

This app was created to demonstrate a minimal Arcana login and point out bugs.

## Reproducing the bug

Run the following to install required node dependencies.

```
$ yarn install
```

Then run 

```
$ yarn start
```

In the app, clicking the _Connect Arcana_ button would spit out an error in the console.
